## 📌 Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand, implement, and analyze the complexity of various clustering algorithms.
- Evaluate their performance using multiple metrics.
- Experiment with real-world datasets and compare custom implementations with Scikit-learn equivalents.

## 🧠 Implemented Clustering Algorithms

The following clustering techniques are implemented and analyzed:

- 📈 **k-means**
- 💎 **k-medoids**
- 🧠 **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
- 🌐 **DBSCAN**
- 📏 **OPTICS**
- 🌲 **BIRCH**
- 💬 **Affinity Propagation**
- 🔄 **Mean Shift**
- 🧩 **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**

## 📐 Evaluation Metrics

All clustering algorithms are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Calinski-Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion)
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
- Mutual Information (MI)
- Split
- Diameter

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **Iris Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/iris-dataset)
- **AI Global Index Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katerynameleshenko/ai-index)
- **Global Earthquake Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/recent-earthquakes)

These datasets are stored in the `datasets/` directory and are used in Part II of the project.

## ⚙️ Features

- Feature scaling and dissimilarity coefficient computations (Euclidean, mixed types).
- Complexity analysis of each algorithm.
- Visual and statistical comparison with Scikit-learn implementations.
- Experimentation with feature selection and metric effectiveness.
